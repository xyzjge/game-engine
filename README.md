XYZ is a LWJGL based 3D game engine 

It supports, among others features:

* OBJ models (single and multiple texture)
* DAE models (animations)
* Sweep sphere collision

If interested you can clone the project simple-demo ( https://github.com/xyzjge/simple-demo ) and follow some programing examples that use the engine.

Here you can see a video of a demo game implemented using the engine (based in the great monolith's blood).
